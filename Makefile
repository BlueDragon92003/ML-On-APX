----------------------------------------------------------------
Functions available in this project:

clean				Removes the current model links and any intermediate files
					used in training models.

clean-identify		Removes the current model softlink and any intermeidate
					files used in training the identification model.

clean-classify		Removes the current model softlink and any intermeidate
					files used in training the classification model.

generate-data		Generates the training and testing data needed to train and
					evaluate the models.

train-identify		Runs the training algorithm for the identification model.
					More information to follow once the identification model
					is designed.

train-classify		Runs the training algorithm for the classification model.
					Once the model stops making significant improvements,
					updates the current model softlink and generates an accuracy
					report.

hls4ml-translate	Convert the generated models for use and testing in FPGAs or
					emulation software for evaluation of success.
